# NUS Orbital 2023: VoluNteerUS
## About
The aim of this project is to develop a web-based volunteering management system that allows undergraduate students to browse volunteering opportunities and sign up for them. The system will also allow committee members from different clubs and organizations within the university to create volunteering events and post them on the platform.
