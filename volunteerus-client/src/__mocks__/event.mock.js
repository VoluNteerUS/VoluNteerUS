		"description": "Formed in October 2002, the NUS Students’ Community Service Club (CSC) is one of the four non faculty Constituent Clubs under the National University of Singapore Students’ Union. NUS CSC is committed to the idea that less fortunate members of our society should never be forgotten, and thus devotes continuous service to the community. Since its inception, CSC has undergone rapid development with the establishment of 12 Regular Volunteering Programmes, 7 Special Projects and 8 Exploratory Programmes. Opportunities are abound for NUS undergraduates. NUS CSC will continuously strengthen its current programmes as well as explore new avenues in order to promote volunteerism amongst the student population, as well as to raise awareness of our beneficiaries amongst the public.",
